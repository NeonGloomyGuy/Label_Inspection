FLOATING-POINT
OVERFLOW
AND
UNDERFLOW
What
happens
if
you
try
to
make
a
float
variable
exceed
its
limits?
For
example,
suppose
you
multiply
10e38
by
100
(overflow)
or
divide
10e—37
by
1000
(underflow)?
The
result
depends
on
the
system.
On
our
system,
any
number
that
overflows
is
replaced
by
the
largest
legal
value,
and
any
number
that
underflows
is
replaced
by
0.
Other
systems
may
issue
warnings
or
balk
or
offer
you
a
choice
of
responses.
If
this
is
a
matter
that
concerns
you,
you'll
have
to
check
out
the
rules
on
your
system.
If
you
can’t
find
the
information,
don’t
be
afraid
to
try
a
little
trial
and
error.
